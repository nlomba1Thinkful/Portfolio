                About Nick
            </h2>
            <p>
                    Working in finance these past couple of years was a blessing in many ways, however, there was a lack of passion I would've wanted to experience to truly commit. There was a time when I has aspirations for a career in tech but gravitated elsewhere becasue of familial ties. It has been extremely rewarding to delve back into this life-long interest of mine and I couldnt be happier with my choice. Outside of that, I'm a Boston-born Floridian who loves to spend time with his Cane Corso. Being born in MA, I'm a loyal Pats fan for life.
                <p>
                    Thinkful has provided me with the resources neccesary to learn and excel so I can chart my own course and tap into a field I wouldnt have had access to without. It goes without saying, I'm truly grateful for the opportunity and the doors it will open!
