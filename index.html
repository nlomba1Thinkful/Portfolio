            <h2>
                About Nick
            </h2>
            <p>
                    There was a time when I had aspirations for a career in tech but ended up pursuing finance, since making the change, I've come to undestand nothing will satisfy my unyielding curiosity and desire to problem solve the way programming & web design has... I've barely scratched the surface and I'm not sure if it's possible to be any more enthused to learn code. Likewise, I'm eager to meet other developers, I look forward to learning, sharing and collaborating on future projects. I often miss the days when teamwork on the football field enabled success not just individually but as a cohesive unit, I can only hope working with other developers will inspire a similiar desire to thrive as a team. Outside of my passion for web development, I love to stay active with crossfit, bodybuilding and yoga. Nutrition is equally important to me, I indulge from time to time but truly enjoy eating clean.
                    <!-- The about me section was marked for revision as well, It's been updated. :)  -->
        
                <p>
                    Thinkful has provided me with the resources neccesary to learn and excel so I can chart my own course and tap into a field I wouldnt have had access to without. It goes without saying, I'm truly grateful for the opportunity and the doors it will open!
